# Sherlock x Cluedo

A little code sample as requested as part of a recruitment process.

I wasn't sure which language to approach this with, I do prefer JavaScript for projects like this simply for ease of use, but as the role is for a .NET Developer, it seemed only right to create it in C#.

It's a simple WinForm app where you can press a button and get the answer, didn't think there was much point in deploying a whole ASP.NET project just for this little thing.

If there's an issue running it after you've cloned the repo (I sincerely hope not!), then the answer I found was Ms. Peacock after 480 minutes.
